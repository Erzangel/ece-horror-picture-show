# ECE Horror Picture Show - Prototype

This repository showcases the AR App prototype built by a student group from ECE Paris, appropriately called ECE Horror Picture Show.

# What is this project?

This project was born from the ambition of a group of ECE students and their teacher to overtake Netflix.
We wish to create a new way to consume <b>horror movies</b> at home, answering the spectator's wish for strong emotions and thrills with <b>Augmented Reality technologies</b>.
