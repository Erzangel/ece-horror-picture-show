# ECE Horror Picture Show, AR Horror Platform project


This repository showcases the AR App prototype built by a student group from ECE Paris, appropriately called ECE Horror Picture Show.

It has three goals:

- providing an *immersive AR horror experience available on any phone, in any living room;*
- constructing the app to let users rent/buy content;
- allowing AR content creators to upload their own AR movies.

# About this project

This project was born from the ambition of a group of ECE students and their teacher to overtake Netflix.
We wish to create a new way to consume <b>horror movies</b> at home, answering the spectator's wish for strong emotions and thrills with <b>Augmented Reality technologies</b>.
