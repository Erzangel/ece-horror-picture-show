# ECE Horror Picture Show - Prototype

This repository contains the AR App prototype built by a student group from ECE Paris, appropriately called ECE Horror Picture Show.

# What is this project?

This project was born from the ambition of a group of ECE students and their teacher to overtake Netflix.
We wish to create a new way to consume <b>horror movies</b> at home, answering the spectator's wish for strong emotions and thrills with <b>Augmented Reality technologies</b>.

# App Features

- A Unity Project that can be built and deployed on any Android/iOS phone equipped with a camera
- Room-scale AR project that detects surfaces around the user
- The user is able to place a zombie when clicking on one of the surfaces (all credits go to the following free Unity Asset Store model: https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/3d/characters/humanoids/zombie-30232)
- Post-processing effects, such as vignette and chromatic aberration are added to the display
